# 🚧 This Project is Under Construction: Hard Hats Required 🚧

Hey there! 🏗️

Welcome to our project’s top-secret transformation phase! 🕵️‍♂️ We’re currently giving it a fabulous makeover, and it's so deep in the process that it's practically taking a nap. Expect to see some cool new features and maybe even a bit of magic once we’re done.

## What’s Happening?

- 🎨 We’re throwing a virtual paint party for the codebase.
- 🔧 Our bugs are getting a thorough bug spray treatment.
- 🛠️ We’re adding some snazzy new features and fixing things that made us go “Hmm.”


## Running the Project

If you’re eager to dive in and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:**

    Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
    ```

2. **Start the Project:**

    Once the dependencies are installed, start the project with:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will fire up the development server and you’ll be able to see the project in action. 🎬
